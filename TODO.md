## Selection

### Tree Section
* Binary Tree + AVL tree + Q&A (45 minutes)
* Minimum Spanning Tree + Q&A (45 minutes)

### Dynamic Algorithms
* What is dynamic programming
* Simple example of why its great (classic fib sequence recursion vs iterative)
* Maximum Subsequence
* Coin change problem?

### Tree Balancing Algorithms
* Red Black vs AVL?

### Graph Algorithms
- Shortest path - Bellman-Ford's vs Dijkstras
- Maximum Flow - Ford-Fulkerson vs Edmonds-Karp vs Dinic's algo
- Strongly Connected Components - Kosarajuâ€™s and Tarjan's algorithm
- Minimum Spanning Trees - Kruskal's vs Prim's
- Cycle Detection - Floyd vs Brent
- Topological Sorting? (probably not?)
