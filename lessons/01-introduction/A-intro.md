## Welcome
But why a part two to the "Last Algorithms Class You Need?"
- Well... as i said in that one, there is more, just not enough time
- Plus this is called The Algorithms Class You Want as it covers the fun stuff!

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

## Prereqs
There is an expectation that you both know how to program and you know your
basic data structures.  You have cursory knowledge of graphs, trees, linked
lists, knowledge of algorithms such as sorting and searching, and Big O basics.

If you are unfamiliar, check out [The Last Algorithms Course You
Need](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/algorithms) as it has everything you
need to get up to speed.

**ITS LITERALLY FREE**

<br/>
<br/>

**YOU SHOULD REALLY KNOW RECURSION**
