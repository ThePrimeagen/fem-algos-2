## Welcome
But why a part two to the "Last Algorithms Class You Need?"
- Well... as i said in that one, there is more, just not enough time
- Plus this is called The Algorithms Class You Want as it covers the fun stuff!

## Prereqs
There is an expectation that you both know how to program and you know your
basic data structures.  You know the basics of data structures such as graphs,
trees, linked lists, knowledge of algorithms such as sorting and searching, and
Big O basics.

If you are unfamiliar, check out [The Last Algorithms Course You
Need](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/algorithms) as it has everything you
need to get up to speed
