### The Maximum Flow problem
This is just one of my favorites from college so we had to do this.
* The Ford-Fulkerson algorithm
  * fun fact, it doesn't specify how to traverse the graph, which makes the algorithm even more interesting.
  * there is no "determined" best way
  * the runtime is a bit wonky

### Lets start with a graph!

### Lets do it again, but try a different path

### The Minimum Cut
A fun part of the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm is that it also is the _minimum_ cut
of the network.  A cut is defined by separating the source from the sink and
creating two disjoined graphs

**don't forget to show that funny car way of determining flow**

### Runtime
