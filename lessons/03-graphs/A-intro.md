### The basic about graphs
* vertex (node) and edge
* undirected vs directed graphs
* weights
* vertices are usually denoted with `u` and `v`
* trees are graphs, they are directed acyclic graphs
  - not all dags are trees, but all trees are dags
  - real world application can be a module system
* complete graph
  - every node has an edge to every other node
* connected components (undirected)
  * strongly connected (directed)

### How to represent a graph
* adjacency matrix
  - pros and cons
* adjacency list
