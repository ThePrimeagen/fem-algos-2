### The basics of AVL trees
* It was invented in 1962 by two Soviets, Georgy Adelson-Velsky and Evgenii Landis
* its the oldest self balancing tree algorithm

<br/>
<br/>

### The two rules of AVL
* it is a BST
* what is balance factor
  * what is the maximum value?
  * h(r) - h(l)

### Rotations
there are 4 total rotations and two sets of rotations possible in an AVL tree.

* the basics of rotations
  * the two single rotations
  * the two double rotations

### Creating Imbalances
Lets insert some nodes and create some bad balances!
* REMINDER: The names of these seem to vary from source to source.  Either
  people say the rotation based on what side is imbalanced or what direction to
  * give quick example of LL tree

lets create a the following trees and fix them!!
* RR (2, 1)
* LL (-2, -1)
* RL (2, -1)
* LR (-2, 1)

<br/>

### Being more complete
All the trees thus far haven't been that complicated, but what if there are a
bunch of children?

Lets look at more complete trees
* LL (fully kid'd)
* LR (fully kid'd)

### Do we have any questions?
* one thing to keep in mind with avl is that you can memorize this pretty much forever
