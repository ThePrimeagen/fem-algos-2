### Lets Review Binary Search Trees
* What is a binary tree
* What is a binary search tree?
* how do we use binary search trees?
  * what is the run time of search? (come back to this one)

* define a Node<T>
* relationships
  * grand parent, parent, uncle, child, decendent
* types
  * nearly complete, complete, and full
* traversals
  * PRE order
  * IN order
  * POST order
* deletion
  * 3 cases
    * no children
    * one child
    * two children
    * what is the runtime?
* insertion
  * what is the runtime?
* what is the problem with binary search trees?
  * insertion order is important!
  * ASK AGAIN: what is the run time of search?

### How to fix binary search trees?
there are two algorithms to fix binary search tree balance problem.

* AVL
* Red Black

I find AVL to be simpler than RB, but i hear often that RB is easier to
implement though my experience was a bit different.
